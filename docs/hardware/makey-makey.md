# Makey Makey

Can you use your [Makey Makeys](https://makeymakey.com/) to control Arcade games? Yes! Yes! Yes!

The Makey Makey keys just need remapping to match the Arcade [controller](https://arcade.makecode.com/reference/controller) keys.
Once remapped, you can use all the awesomeness of Makey Makey to build fun controllers for your games (for up to 2 players!). 

## Remapping your Makey Makey

* Go to https://makeymakey.com/pages/remap to start the remapping process.
* Change the keys so that they match the ones in the following image:

## Playing your games

You can play your Arcade games right in the editor or by simply clicking **Share** and playing them from the shared page. **Make sure to set focus to the game area on the screen so that it receives the keyboard commands**.

Have fun!
